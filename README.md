# ToxicFrog's Doom Mods

This repo contains some Doom mods. These are all ZScript-based and thus require a recent (4.x) release of [gzDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads); they will not work on other ports.

Downloadable versions can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/laevis/releases); the latest release will always contain the latest version of each mod, even if they weren't updated in that release.

## Included Mods

- [libtooltipmenu](libtooltipmenu/), a library adding support for tooltips in the option menu. **This is absolutely required for the other mods in this repo to function**, as they use it to add in-game documentation to the mod settings.
- [Laevis](laevis/), a mod of growing your guns from small shrubs into beautiful murder trees. Earn XP for your weapons by killing hellspawn and customize them with randomized upgrades. Compatible with almost every IWAD and mod.
- [Indestructable](indestructable/), a minimod that gives you a second chance on death, inspired by [War of Attrition's](https://fissile.duke4.net/fissile_attrition.html) "Death Rage" mechanic.
