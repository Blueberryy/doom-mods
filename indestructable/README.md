# Indestructable - an extra lives mini-mod

This mod is a standalone version of Laevis's planned *Indestructable* upgrade, which gives you a limited number of opportunities to cheat death. When you die, if it has any charges left, you instead get a partial heal and a short-lived buff containing invincibility, time stop, and double damage.

It is highly configurable, but the default settings mimic the Death Rage mechanic (from *Duke Nukem 3D: War of Attrition*) that inspired it: 10 second duration, triggers once per level and recharges at the end of the level.

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with anything. If using it with Laevis, you should load it after Laevis proper.

## License

This is released under the same MIT license as the rest of Laevis.
