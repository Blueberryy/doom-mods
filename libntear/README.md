# libntear - zscript utility library

This is a utility library for the other mods in this repo. It does nothing when loaded on its own, but is required for them to function.

The functionality in it may be useful to other modders; feel free to use it (either as an external dependency or by copying some or all of it into your own mods).

## TFLIB_TooltipOptionsMenu



## TFLIB_Util

This mod should be compatible with anything. If using it with Laevis, you should load it after Laevis proper.

## License

This is released under the same MIT license as the rest of Laevis.


`TooltipOptionsMenu.zs` is a drop-in replacement for `OptionsMenu` that supports tooltips in the MENUDEF. It has no external dependencies, is backwards compatible with existing `OptionsMenu` MENUDEFs, and is (like the rest of this mod) MIT licensed, so feel free to use it in your own mods.
